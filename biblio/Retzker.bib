Abstract      = {The limits of frequency resolution measurements have been discussed
extensively in recent years. It is believed that there is a crucial difference
between resolution and the precision of a single frequency tracking. Whereas
the efficiency of frequency tracking gradually increases with the square root
of the number of measurements, the ability to resolve two frequencies is
limited by the specific time scale of the probe and cannot be compensated for
by extra measurements. Here we show theoretically and demonstrate
experimentally that the relationship between these quantities is more subtle
and for some limits both quantities behave in a similar way.},
