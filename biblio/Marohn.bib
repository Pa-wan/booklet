Abstract      = {Aligning a microcantilever to an area of interest on a sample is a critical
step in many scanning probe microscopy experiments, particularly those carried
out on devices and rare, precious samples. We report a series of protocols that
rapidly and reproducibly align a high-compliance microcantilever to a $< 10 \:
\mu\mathrm{m}$ sample feature under high vacuum and at cryogenic temperatures.
The first set of protocols, applicable to a cantilever oscillating parallel to
the sample surface, involves monitoring the cantilever resonance frequency
while laterally scanning the tip to map the sample substrate through
electrostatic interactions of the substrate with the cantilever. We demonstrate
that when operating a cantilever a few micrometers from the sample surface,
large shifts in the cantilever resonance frequency are present near the edges
of a voltage biased sample electrode. Surprisingly, these "edge-finder"
frequency shifts are retained when the electrode is coated with a polymer film
and a $\sim 10 \: \mathrm{nm}$ thick metallic ground plane. The second series
of methods, applicable to any scanning probe microscopy experiment, integrated
a single-optical fiber to image line scans of the sample surface. The straight
forward microscope modifications required to implement these methods have
demonstrated reliable, micrometer scale precision, while decreasing the
experimental setup time from days to hours in a vacuum, cryogenic magnetic
resonance force microscope.},
