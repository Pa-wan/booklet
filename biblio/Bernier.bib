Abstract      = {Level repulsion - the opening of a gap between two degenerate modes due to
coupling - is ubiquitous anywhere from solid state theory to quantum chemistry.
In contrast, if one mode has negative energy, the mode frequencies attract
instead. They converge and develop imaginary components, leading to an
instability; an exceptional point marks the transition. This, however, only
occurs if the dissipation rates of the two modes are equal. Here we expose a
theoretical framework for the process and realize it experimentally through
engineered dissipation in a multimode superconducting microwave optomechanical
circuit. Level attraction is observed for a mechanical oscillator and a
superconducting microwave cavity, while an auxiliary cavity is used for
sideband cooling. Two exceptional points are demonstrated that could be
exploited for their topological properties.},
