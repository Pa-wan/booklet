Abstract      = {In spintronic materials, control and transport of magnetic order require a
fundamental understanding of the way spins interact with the surrounding
crystal lattice. However, direct measurement and analysis even of basic
collective processes such as spin-phonon equilibration have remained
challenging. Here, we reveal the flow of energy and angular momentum in the
model insulating ferrimagnet yttrium iron garnet, following resonant lattice
excitation. Remarkably, on a time scale as fast as 1 ps, spins and phonons
reach quasi-equilibrium in terms of energy through phonon-induced modulation of
the exchange interaction. This mechanism leads to identical demagnetization of
the ferrimagnet's two spin sublattices. The resulting spin pressure is released
by angular-momentum equilibration on a much slower, 100 ns time scale. Our
results indicate that the spin Seebeck effect and efficient spin control by
phonons can be extended to antiferromagnets and into the terahertz frequency
range.},
