Abstract      = {We propose a design of a THz-frequency signal generator based on a layered
structure consisting of a current-driven platinum (Pt) layer and a layer of an
antiferromagnet (AFM) with easy-plane anisotropy, where the magnetization
vectors of the AFM sublattices are canted inside the easy plane by the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). The DC electric current flowing in the
Pt layer creates, due to the spin-Hall effect, a perpendicular spin current
that, being injected in the AFM layer, tilts the DMI-canted AFM sublattices out
of the easy plane, thus exposing them to the action of a strong internal
exchange magnetic field of the AFM. The sublattice magnetizations, along with
the small net magnetization vector $\textbf{m}_{\rm DMI}$ of the canted AFM,
start to rotate about the hard anisotropy axis of the AFM with the THz
frequency proportional to the injected spin current and the AFM exchange field.
The rotation of the small net magnetization $\textbf{m}_{\rm DMI}$ results in
the THz-frequency dipolar radiation that can be directly received by an
adjacent (e.g. dielectric) resonator. We demonstrate theoretically that the
radiation frequencies in the range $f=0.05-2$~THz are possible at the
experimentally reachable magnitudes of the driving current density, and
evaluate the power of the signal radiated into different types of resonators,
showing that this power increases with the increase of frequency $f$, and that
it could exceed 1~$\mu$W at $f \sim 0.5$~THz for a typical dielectric resonator
of the electric permittivity $\varepsilon \sim 10$ and quality factor $Q \sim
750$.},
