Abstract      = {We show that high concentration of skyrmions can be achieved in magnetic
films with quenched disorder. A 2D system of Heisenberg spins with feromagnetic
exchange, $J$, and random magnetic anisotropy of strength $D_R \ll J$ has been
studied. Analytical theory for the dependence of the average skyrmion size on
the magnetic field $H$, and for the stability of pinned skyrmions, is
complemented by numerical studies of 2D lattices containing up to 40 million
spins. At low fields the average size of the skyrmion, $\lambda$, is determined
by the average size of Imry-Ma domains. On increasing the field the skyrmions
first shrink, with $\lambda \propto D_R/H$, and then collapse at fields
distributed around $H_c \propto D_R^{4/3}$. Concentration of the skyrmions goes
down with the field as $\exp[-(H/H_c)^{3/2}]$.},

Title         = {Skyrmion Clusters From Bloch Lines in Ferromagnetic Films},
Eprint        = {1706.02994v1},
ArchivePrefix = {arXiv},
PrimaryClass  = {cond-mat.other},
Abstract      = {With the development of nanofabrication and nanoscale measuring techniques a
large variety of topological magnetic objects has been recently observed in
thin magnetic films. Conditions under which they emerge in experiment remain
largely unexplained. In this paper we show that the emergence of multiskyrmion
clusters from laminar domains on application of the magnetic field is governed
by the configuration of Bloch lines inside domain walls. Spin lattices
corresponding to films of finite thickness with ferromagnetic exchange,
magnetic anisotropy, and dipole-dipole interaction have been simulated.
Depending on the combination of Bloch lines, the magnetic domains evolve into
individual skyrmions, biskyrmions, triskyrmions, or more complex skyrmion
clusters. While the geometry of the cluster is sensitive to the parameters, its
topological charge is uniquely determined by the topological charge of Bloch
lines inside the magnetic domain from which the cluster emerges.},
