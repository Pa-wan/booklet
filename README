The concept should be as simple as letting the participants filling up themselves a csv database (see google webform example)
with all the informations concerning their affilitation and their talk, and the organizer filling up a program.txt timetable,
and then compile automatically the book of abstract!
(NB: bibligraphy is also managed automatically by just providing the DOI)


compile timetable
./timetable/build_schedule.py

compile schedule
./make_scedule.py

compile agenda
./timetable/agenda.py

compile abstracts
./webform/generate_abstract.py
