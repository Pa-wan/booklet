Spinmechanics discusses in the most general sense how spin or magnetization properties couple to lattice degrees of freedom. 
In my presentation, I will give an overview over various manifestiations of spinmechanical effects. In particular, I will discuss (i) the sensing of magnetoelasticity via the mechanical properties of nano-mechanical string resonators, enabling direct access to nanoscale magnetic objects, (ii) the mechanical sensing of spin accumulation in metals, and (iii) the electroelastic control of of the spin-properties in paramagnetic ensambles.
