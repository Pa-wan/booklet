The coupling between spin and mechanical degrees of freedom in condensed matter manifests itself in different equilibrium and non-equilibrium situations. Magnetic insulators such as yttrium iron garnet with high magnetic and mechanical quality are very suited to study such spin mechanical effects. In the past wo years we addressed their effects on the FMR or isolated nanoparticles \cite{Keshtgar_2017} and optical properties \cite{Shen_2015,Hashimoto_2017} and spin Seebeck effect of thin films \cite{Kikkawa_2016,Flebus_2017,Cornelissen_2017,Cornelissen_2016}.
In this talk I will review these topics and present new results with focus on the theoretical description.
