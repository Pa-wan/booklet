We present a 'nanoladder' design that minimizes the mechanical dissipation of ultrasensitive cantilevers. A nanoladder cantilever consists of a lithographically patterned scaffold of rails and rungs with a feature size between 100-300 nm. Compared to a rectangular beam of the same dimensions, the mass and spring constant of such a nanoladder is reduced by roughly two orders of magnitude. We demonstrate a high force sensitivity of $150 \substack{+60 \\ -40}$ zN$/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ at $103\text{mK}$ for device made from both silicon and diamond. Opposed to bottom-up mechanical resonators like nanowires or nanotubes, nanoladders can be batch fabricated using standard lithography procedures, which is a critical factor for applications in scanning force microscopy.
