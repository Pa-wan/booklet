Atomistic spin dynamics is a classical formalism in which dynamics and thermodynamics of magnetic materials can be calculated. We focus our studies on magnetic insulators such as yttrium iron garnet (YIG) which is ubiquitous in the insulator spintronics, magnonics and spin mechanics communities. We have extended the classical spin dynamics formalism into the `semi-classical` limit such that the magnons obey quantum statistics whilst the spins remain classical objects. This leads to a vast improvement in the quantitative calculation of material properties such as the magnon heat capacity. We will show recent progress in the calculation of magnon transport properties. We also present experimental evidence and a simple model for a spin-phonon interaction in the THz regime where the phonon excitation dynamically modifies the super exchange coupling leading to a transfer of spin angular moment between the two sublattices \cite{1710.02700v1}. This causes the sublattice magnetization to decrease but maintains the total magnetization through angular momentum conservation.
