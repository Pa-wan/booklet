The storied role of mechanical measurements in the elucidation of physical phenomena continues unabated.  We review recent progress in instrumentation for mechanical detection of magnetic torques, along with current and potential applications.  Nanofabrication has led to a good variety of well-coupled magnetic/mechanical structures, and a roster of powerful techniques for observing nanomechanical responses to magnetic torque.  

Following a broader overview\cite{Moreland_2003,Lipfert_2014,Forstner_2014,Zhang_2016}, we will survey advances driven by progress in optomechanics for torque sensing.  High-finesse optical cavities for readout of mechanical motion have been harnessed for sensitive magnetometries and susceptometries\cite{Kim_2013,Wu_2014}.  The parameter space for further improvement continues to expand, for example through the introduction of optical traps for nanotorsional applications, torsional metamaterials, and magnetic feedback cooling of torque sensors\cite{Hoang_2016,Frenzel_2017,Kim_2017}.
