I will discuss recent experiments in our group aimed at determining the magnetization configuration and reversal processes in nanometer-scale magnets. First, I will discuss sensitive measurements of torque magnetometry and how they can be used to observe magnetization reversal and magnetic phase transitions in individual nanomagnets. I will then discuss the advantages of scaling down mechanical torque transducers from conventional 'top-down' cantilever sensors to state-of-the-art 'bottom-up' structures. In particular, I will show torque magnetometry experiments using nanowire (NW) structures. Finally, I will introduce our scanning probe experiments aimed at imaging magnetism on the nanometer-scale. In this context, I will discuss experiments using a scanning nanometer-scale superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) to map the stray magnetic field produced by individual nanomagnets.
