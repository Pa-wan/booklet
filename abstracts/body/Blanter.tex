Brillouin light scattering is an established technique to study magnons, the elementary excitations of a magnet. Its efficiency can be enhanced by cavities that concentrate the light intensity. Here, we theoretically study inelastic scattering of photons by a magnetic sphere that supports optical whispering gallery modes in a plane normal to the magnetization. Magnons with low angular momenta scatter the light in the forward direction with a pronounced asymmetry in the Stokes and the anti-Stokes scattering strength, consistent with earlier studies. Magnons with large angular momenta constitute Damon Eschbach modes are shown to inelastically reflect light. The reflection spectrum contains either a Stokes or anti-Stokes peak, depending on the direction of the magnetization, a selection rule that can be explained by the chirality of the Damon Eshbach magnons. The controllable energy transfer can be used to manage the thermodynamics of the magnet by light \cite{Sharma_2017}. We will also discuss recent developments in magnon cooling and manipulation.
