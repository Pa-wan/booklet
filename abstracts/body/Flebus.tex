NV centers have been recently growing in popularity due to their minimally invasive and high-resolution magnetic-field sensing. Here, we focus on the NV-center relaxometry as a method to probe collective excitations in magnetic insulators \cite{Du_2017}. We develop a general framework that relates the experimentally-measurable NV-center relaxation times to the properties of the magnetic system via the noise emitted by the latter. We suggest that NV-relaxometry can be effectively deployed to image low-lying collective excitations in the vicinity of antiferromagnetic solitons, as well as open prospects to nonintrusively probe spin-wave transport regimes in magnetic insulators.
