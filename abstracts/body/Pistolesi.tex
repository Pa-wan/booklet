In this talk we consider a semiconducting carbon nanotube (CNT) lying on a ferromagnetic insulating substrate with one end passing the substrate and suspended over a metallic gate. We assume that the polarized substrate induces an exchange interaction acting as a local magnetic field for the electrons in the nonsuspended CNT side.  We show that one can generate electrostatically a tunable spin-polarized polaronic state localized at the bending end of the CNT. We argue that at low temperatures manipulation and detection of the localized quantum spin state are possible (see also \cite{Pistolesi_2015}).
