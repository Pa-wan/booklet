Nanowire crystals are excellent candidates for next-generation ultrasensitive scanning force probes. They can be grown in a variety of sizes and from different materials, allowing access to a wide range of resonant frequencies and spring constants. By virtue of slight asymmetries in geometry, a nanowire's flexural modes can be split into doublets which oscillate along two orthogonal axes. By monitoring the frequency shift and direction of oscillation of both modes as we scan the nanowire above a sample surface, we construct a map of all in-plane tip-sample force gradients\cite{Rossi_2016}. We expand on this work and show that the two orthogonal modes exhibit coherent dynamics, through the demonstration of avoided crossings between the modes as well as Rabi oscillations. We deterministically tune both the coupling strength and the frequency of the modes by positioning the nanowire at suitable points in the electrostatic vector force field generated by the sample. The demonstrated coherent dynamics can be used to implement control protocols and spectroscopic measurements similar to those used in experimental quantum compuation and sensing.
