The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre in diamond is a leading system for the detection and spectroscopy of spins in nanoscale samples. Most sensing schemes rely on driving of the NV spins with pulsed radiofrequency fields to engineer the NV Hamiltonian and make it sensitive to the target spins. In this talk, I will present an alternative approach to sensing that utilises cross-relaxation between the target spins and the probe NV spin, enabling all-optical spectroscopy of nearby electronic and nuclear spins \cite{Hall_2016,Wood_2016,Wood_2017}. I will then show how cross-relaxation can be used to transfer polarisation to the sample, with an efficiency enhanced by up to an order of magnitude over the established Hartmann-Hahn method, leading to the first observation of hyperpolarisation of external spins using a single NV probe \cite{1708.05906v2}. These results suggest that cross-relaxation could be a useful for nanoscale magnetic resonance imaging.
