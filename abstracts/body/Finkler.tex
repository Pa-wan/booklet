With recent reports on the sensing of electron spins and nuclear spins
from single proteins using the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond, we
attempt to constrain the number of participating spins. This is achieved
by using doubly spin-labeled amino acids. Both room temperature and low
temperature measurements are presented. We also show how one can gauge
the dipolar couplng between a pair of spin labels in the limit of a very
small ($<4$) amount of molecules \cite{Schlipf_2017}. This is an almost mandatory
requirement for sensing spins in more complex (and of interest for
active research) molecules. Finally, we stress the importance of
quantum-assisted methods in reducing the effective measurement time,
which is critical for imaging purposes \cite{H_berle_2017}.
