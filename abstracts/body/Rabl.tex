The coherent integration of individual quantum systems into larger networks is one of the main challenges for the realization of quantum technologies. The rapid progress in the fabrication and control of micro- and nanomechanical systems opens many new possibilities to achieve this goal by using functionalized micro- and nanomechanical resonators  for the conversion and transduction of quantum signals between different spin-, charge-,  or optical qubit systems. In this tutorial I will review some of the basic schemes for coupling mechanical resonators to other microscopic quantum systems with the main focus being placed on spin qubits associated with defect centers in diamond. In the second part of the tutorial I will then discuss how such hybrid spin-mechanics systems can potentially be used for quantum information processing applications.
