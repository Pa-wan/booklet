Mechanical resonators based on carbon nanotubes feature a series of truly exceptional properties. Carbon nanotubes are so small that they make the lightest resonators fabricated thus far. In addition, the quality factor Q becomes extremely large at cryogenic temperature, up to 5 million~\cite{G_ttinger_2017}. Because of this combination of low mass and high quality factor, the motion is enormously sensitive to the environment. The most notable consequence is that nanotube resonators are exceptional sensors of force~\cite{G_ttinger_2017}. The thermal force noise can reach the level of $\sim 1$ zN/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$. In this talk, I will present our efforts to detect the nuclear spins of the $^{13}$C atoms naturally present in the carbon nanotube.
