A nanoscale scanning diamond magnetometer (NSDM) utilizes a quantum object $-$ a single magnetic impurity in a diamond probe tip $-$ as an atomic size magnetic field sensor. This impurity, which is known as the nitrogen vacancy center (or NV center), can be detected by optical readout. The scanning diamond magnetometer takes advantage of quantum control techniques and quantum coherence to achieve very high magnetic field sensitivities and to access new modes of measurement, such as noise spectroscopy.
On this poster, we present our groups efforts taken towards applying NSDM for the study of electron transport phenomena in the context of mesoscopic condensed matter physics. We will highlight the technology necessary for this endeavor, especially the scanning probe instrumentation and high-quality quantum probes made from single crystal diamond. Examples of imaging current flow in nanoscale metallic wires and carbon nanotubes will also be shown \cite{Chang_2017}.
