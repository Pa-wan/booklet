Creating and studying coherent interactions between solid-state qubits and mechanical resonators is a challenge at the intersection of atomic physics, condensed matter physics, and engineering. Furthermore, there is growing consensus that mechanical motion is a “plastic” degree of freedom for solid-state qubits, with the potential to form a interface between spins, photons and phonons.  This has motivated intense research into the coherent interactions between mechanical resonators and qubits formed from photons, trapped atoms, superconducting circuits, quantum dots, and nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, to name a few.  I will describe our experiments to coherently control NV center spins through their coupling to the dynamic crystal lattice strain of a gigahertz-frequency mechanical resonator.  In high-quality diamond mechanical resonators, we demonstrate coherent Rabi oscillations of NV center spins driven by mechanical motion instead of an oscillating magnetic field \cite{MacQuarrie_2013,MacQuarrie_2015}. Furthermore, we show that a mechanical resonator is a resource to prolog the NV center’s spin coherence \cite{MacQuarrie_2015}.  Finally, we examine how resonator strain can couple to NV centers through their excited-state, using either spin-strain coupling at room temperature \cite{MacQuarrie_2017} or orbital-strain coupling low temperature.
