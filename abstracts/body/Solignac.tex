The aim of the project is to develop a characterization tool of the magnetic properties of the material surface at nano-scale by combining very sensitive magnetoresistive sensors and atomic force microscopy. This tool will have three main applications: magnetic nanometrology, magnetic susceptibility imaging and micro imaging of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.  
The magnetic sensors used are based on spin electronics and could be giant magnetoresistance (GMR) or Tunnel MagnetoResistance (TMR) with a detectivity between the nT/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ and the pT/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ (10-9 to 10-12 T/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$) and a large dynamic range from DC to 10MHz. The sensors will be integrated in an AFM cantilever with micro and nanofabrication techniques to achieve hundred nm range resolution. 
The characteristics of the first micron size GMR sensor integrated in AFM cantilever will be shown as well as the first magnetic images of magnetic grids.
