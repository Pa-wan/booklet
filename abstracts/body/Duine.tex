We consider spin-rotation coupling --- the generation of spin polarization by vorticity --- in viscous two-dimensional electron systems with spin-orbit coupling. We derive the hydrodynamic equations for spin and momentum densities in which their mutual coupling is determined by the rotational viscosity. We compute the rotational viscosity microscopically in the limits of weak and strong spin-orbit coupling. Estimates, based on recent experimental results, show that the spin-orbit coupling is strong enough for the spin-rotation coupling to be observed. On the one hand, this coupling provides a way to image viscous electron flows by imaging spin densities. On the other hand, we show that the spin polarizations generated by spin-rotation coupling in the hydrodynamic regime can, in principle, be much larger than the spin polarization generated, e.g. by the spin Hall effect, in the diffusive regime.
