Spin waves are the elementary spin excitations of magnetic materials that may play a key role in future information processing. Spin waves can be probed via the magnetic fields they generate, but this requires a technique with high sensitivity and nanometer sensor-sample distances. I will present the use of the excellent magnetic-field sensitivity of nitrogen-vacancy sensor spins in diamond to explore spin-wave physics in ferromagnets. I will describe local characterization of spin-wave resonances, thermally excited spin waves, and spin-wave chemical potentials . These techniques open up exciting possibilities for nanoscale imaging and control of spin transport in mesoscopic spin systems.
