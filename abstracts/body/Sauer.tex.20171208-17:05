Nanomechanical torque magnetometry is performed on bilayer Co/CoO$_{x}$ micro-disk systems using silicon-on-insulator torsion paddle resonators. The bilayer consists of a base layer of 20 nm of sputtered Co followed by 10 nm of reactively sputtered CoO$_{x}$. The CoO$_{x}$ is deposited onto the Co without breaking vacuum. Disks of 1 and 1.5 $\mu$~m diameter are deposited on symmetrical, doubly-clamped, single paddle, torsion resonators with fundamental frequencies near 10 MHz. The effects of geometric confinement on antiferromagnetic systems are investigated through magnetization vs. field measurements taken on the disks at 300 K, 280 K, 50 K, and 30 K. This corresponds to temperatures above and below the N\'{e}el temperature of CoO (291 K) and Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$ (40 K). These measurements are taken with the sample cooled at both high and low fields, and the results are compared to measurements taken on the deposited continuous film.
