Generation and utilization of a flow of spin angular momentum of electrons in condensed matter, called spin current, are the key challenge of today's nano-scale magnetism and spintronics. The discovery of the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) \cite{Saitoh_2006}, the conversion of spin current into electric voltage via spin-orbit interaction, has allowed researchers to detect and utilize spin current directly, and, since then, many spin-current driven effects have been discovered by exploiting the ISHE. In my talk, I will give an introduction to the following topics: \begin{enumerate} \item Spin-Liquid spin current carried by spinons \cite{Hirobe_2016}, \item Phonon anomaly in spin Seebeck effects \cite{Kikkawa_2016}, and \item Spin current coupled with mechanical motion \cite{Takahashi_2015},\end{enumerate} to discuss the general mechanism of spin-current interaction.
