Welcome to the joint workshop Spin Mechanics and Nano-MRI, whose
purpose is to bring together these two communities interested in the
broader development of novel techniques to excite and detect spin
dynamics at the nanoscale. Following invigorating meetings in USA,
Switzerland, Japan, Germany, and Canada, the Universit√© Grenoble-Alpes
/ CNRS / CEA-Grenoble are honoured to host this workshop in Chamonix,
nestled in the magnificent settings of the Mont Blanc. We are
especially happy to welcome you here at the \'Ecole de Physique des
Houches, which has the notoriety of inviting future Nobel prize
winner! This workshop brings together leading researchers working on
all different perspectives of spin mechanics and nano-MRI which we
hope will stimulate further progress in the understanding and control
of coupled spin-mechanical-optical-electronic systems.  The program
will include 42 invited oral presentations and 24 posters. In addition
4 tutorials talks will lay a foundation of knowledge for non experts,
enabling cross pollination of ideas between the subfields of spin
mechanics. There is also ample time set aside for discussion sessions
in the inspiring setting of the french Alps.  We look forward to a
week of inspiring scientific discussion and we wish you a rewarding
and fruitful experience.  On Behalf of the Organizing Committee.
